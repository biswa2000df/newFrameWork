			//the real work for integrating github with jenkins are while commiting the code then it is automatically build
			need one application     "ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64"   this is the appplication name
			in my system the application are kept in the     "â€ªC:\Users\biswa\ngrok.exe"     this location
			* Main work of the application are to convert the jenkins url to another url which are use to integrate "github-webhook" to  jenkins
			first install the application then follow the authentication like register then generate the token then register, 
			after completion of the registration then open the application and run the command like    "ngrok http [port]" means ngrok http 8080
			which port are jenkins are running that port
			then u got the url then click on the url and accepth the permission then put the url in the github webhook means,
			open the github then click on the perticular repository then click on the settion then click on the left site written "webhook" then right side open to "add webhook", how to add like
			what u get the url "https://8a22-45-117-212-26.ngrok-free.app"and add the extra "/github-webhook/", 
			so the final u put the github webbook url are   =            " https://8a22-45-117-212-26.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/"
			then click and add then refresh the page then u check the right sign are showing or not, if showing then it is connected or some problem are there.
			
			
			then u commit and push the code to the github then jenkins are automatically build automatically.
